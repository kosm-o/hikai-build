But at times I need something more intangible, beyond these physical confines. I&#39;ve found tarot to be a nice pocket sized gateway to some spiritual guidance. Some say it&#39;s based in a thousands year old tradition, perhaps due for some freshening up. In my tarot-pulling-introspective-journaling practice I often wished I had a nice place to keep track of it all, separate from my earthly journaling. So I made tarot garden (it loads slowly because I don&#39;t want to pay for speed). Tarot made easy with links to my favorite tarot interpretations for each card. Sign up today! (don&#39;t forget your password or you will be locked out forever until I build a forgot your password thing which may be never)"
