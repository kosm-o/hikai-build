The beats, the melodies, I can just feel them with my whole being. It&#39;s like I&#39;m a part of the song and we move together. I want to capture this feeling in an immersive and immediate movement experience, where body and music are one, but where movement is the driving force. Full form expressive dancing/wiggling/anything transformed into sound.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z4tCt_v9Eg"

The three usual waveform suspects and a random wavetabley option with a simple X/Y interface to control a filter and envelope. Also has support for USB MIDI keyboard control (refresh after plugging in a keyboard). Play the keyboard with the keys in this layout. Behold noise garden (it loads slowly because I don&#39;t want to pay for speed)."
