The beats, the melodies, I can just feel them with my whole being. It&#39;s like I&#39;m a part of the song and we move together. I want to capture this feeling in an immersive and immediate movement experience, where body and music are one, but where movement is the driving force. Full form expressive dancing/wiggling/anything transformed into sound.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8z4tCt_v9Eg"

But at times I need something more intangible, beyond these physical confines. I&#39;ve found tarot to be a nice pocket sized gateway to some spiritual guidance. Some say it&#39;s based in a thousands year old tradition, perhaps due for some freshening up. In my tarot-pulling-introspective-journaling practice I often wished I had a nice place to keep track of it all, separate from my earthly journaling. So I made tarot garden (it loads slowly because I don&#39;t want to pay for speed). Hosting stopped being free so it&#39;s no longer alive on the web ): Tarot made easy with links to my favorite tarot interpretations for each card. Sign up today!
